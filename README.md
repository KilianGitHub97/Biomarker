# Biomarker

This is the report for the project "Early Biomarkers for Morbus Parkinson" that I have conducted to introduce
myself to the python data-science libraries. The data stems from a research paper on automatic speech processing
from Hlavnicka et al. (2017) The data was collected between 2014 ans 2016 in the Czech Republic. The study
included 30 recently diagnosed and untreated Morbus Parkinson patients, idiopathic RBD (which is a strong
predictor of Morbus Parkinson) and 50 healthy controls. All probands participated in two speeking tasks (reading,
monologue). The goal of the study was to automate the analysis of recordings of the patients, which worked out
very well. Hlavnicka et al. (2017) published the dataset within their appendix and it was reposted on Kaggle. The
research paper and the kaggle dataset can be accessed via the following links:
